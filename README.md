It is a simple card guessing game. If you think that the next card from the deck will be higher you swipe up, if you think it will be lower than you swipe down and if you think that it will be the same you double-tap it.
The final goal is to guess five cards in a row.
If you want to spice things up, drink a shot every time you miss.
